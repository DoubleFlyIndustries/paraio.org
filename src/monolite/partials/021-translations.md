Translations are Para objects which contain a single translation of a string. For example you can have a language file
in English and for each string you can create a `Translation` object with the translation of that string.

Translations have a key and a value. The key is used to identify the string to be translated. Each translation also has
a specific locale associated with it.

A translation can be approved which makes it possible to build a crowdsourced system for translation of language packs.
