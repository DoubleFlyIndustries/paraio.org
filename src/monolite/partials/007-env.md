`para.env` is an important configuration property that turns features on and off. There are three main
values for it - `embedded`, `development`, `production`, but you can define more.

When you are in `embedded` mode Para will use ElasticSearch as both data store and a search engine. ElasticSearch will
load on each redeploy here. This is the simplest way to get started with Para as you don't need to configure anything.

**Warning:** Embedded mode is _not_ recommended for production (duh!).

When you are in `development` mode Para will try to connect to a DynamoDB server running on `localhost`. It will also
try to connect to a local ElasticSearch server. This mode was created so that you can keep your DB and search
servers running in the background while developing your application rather than loading them on each deploy. This will
make redeploys a bit faster.

Finally when you are ready to deploy your app to a real server set `para.env` to `production`. This will enable object
caching and will try to connect to the real AWS DynamoDB service. Also you have to set up a new node for ElasticSearch
or run it locally.
