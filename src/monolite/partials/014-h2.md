title: H2 DB
category: Persistence
---

This is the default database for storing object storage since v1.25. It is lightweight and embedded, which speeds up the
startup of the server. All tables are stored inside a `./data` folder by default. Keep in mind that each app has its
own table which is created automatically when the app is created.

There are several configuration properties for H2 (these go in your `application.conf` file):

<table class="table table-striped">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>property</th>
			<th>description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>`para.db.dir`</td><td> The data directory for storing DB files. Defaults to `./data`.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>`para.db.user`</td><td> The username with access to the database. Defaults to `para`.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>`para.db.password`</td><td> The password. Defaults to `secret`.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>`para.db.tcpServer`</td><td> Parameters for the H2 TCP server. Defaults to `-baseDir ./data`.</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

> This implementation is works well for both development and production environments.
